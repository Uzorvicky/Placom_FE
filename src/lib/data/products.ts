        "I used to worry every harvest season. Sometimes, I'd lose over half of my potatoes due to poor storage or lack of buyers. PLACOM changed that story. Now, my produce goes from farm to warehouse, and from there to buyers I never had access to before. I even got a better price than the local market! For the first time in years, my farm is profitable.",

The platform connected me to a distributor in Abuja who now buys my onions in bulk. My children no longer have to miss school during harvest just to help with selling. We are moving forward!",

I now store my onions in the new facility and access market pricing through the platform. It's like stepping into a new world of farming where the farmer finally has power and clarity.",
